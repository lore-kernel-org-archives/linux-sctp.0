I did a check, and FIELD_SIZEOF() is used about 350x, while =
sizeof_field()
is about 30x, and SIZEOF_FIELD() is only about 5x.

That said, I'm much more in favour of "sizeof_field()" or =
"sizeof_member()"
than FIELD_SIZEOF().  Not only does that better match "offsetof()", with
which it is closely related, but is also closer to the original =
"sizeof()".

Since this is a rather trivial change, it can be split into a number of
patches to get approval/landing via subsystem maintainers, and there is =
no
huge urgency to remove the original macros until the users are gone.  It
would make sense to remove SIZEOF_FIELD() and sizeof_field() quickly so
they don't gain more users, and the remaining FIELD_SIZEOF() users can =
be
whittled away as the patches come through the maintainer trees.

Cheers, Andreas
