Thank you very much David! I really appreciate you taking so many of these conversions in
one go! I will stop for now :) 

With regards to net, I only have networking drivers left (16 patches in total), but I can submit them in the
next round. Will go bug other subsystem maintainers next :) 

Best Regards,
Elena.
