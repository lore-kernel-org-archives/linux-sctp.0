Hi,

That is correct. If you look at coregrind/m_syswrap/syswrap-generic.c
(msghdr_foreachfield), it explicitly says:

   /* msg_flags is completely ignored for send_mesg, recv_mesg doesn't read
      the field, but does write to it. */

So the various valgrind syscall wrappers will not be called to inspect
the msg_flags field. This means you don't get warned if the msg_flags
field contains undefined bits for any syscall send_msg variant.

We have abstracted the checking a bit so it can be reused for the
different ways a msg can be send, through socketcall, sendmsg and
sendmmsg. I am not sure we can easily determine the underlying socket
type. It seems to mean we would have to track the creation of all
socketfds. So having a flag bit for sendmsg and sendmmsg would be much
nicer.

Thanks,

Mark
